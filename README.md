BUILDING
========

After cloning the repo, (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/izrik/Ligra.git`), the submodules must be setup. The `setup-submodules.sh` shell script will do it for you automatically, if you're on a unix/linux/macos system.

Once the source and submodules are setup, you can compile with your favorite tool, such as Visual Studio, MonoDevelop, `msbuild`, or `xbuild`.
