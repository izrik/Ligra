Mathematics Visualization and Simulation Program


BUILDING
========

After cloning the repo, (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/izrik/Ligra.git`), the submodules must be setup. The `make-ready.sh` shell script will do it for you automatically, if you're on a unix/linux/maxos system.

Once the source and submodules are setup, you can compile with your favorite toole, such as Visual Studio, MonoDevelop, `msbuild`, or `xbuild`.
