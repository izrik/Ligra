parametrics and plots
    Once we have parametric exressions in solus, we'll be able to treat the
            "for x=..." as part of the expression instead of part of the plot
            command. we should be able to start plotting a wider variety of
            things, without having to explicitly state the the dimensions and
            variables and such. So  "plot sin(x) for -5<x<5" can be replaced
            with "plot sin(x)" and still plot the sine wave. The "for" and
            boundaries on the variable are no longer necessary. If they are not
            provided, the plot command can make some educated guesses about
            good defaults for the view boundaries.

    "plot f(x,t) for (x=...,t=...)" 2 inputs, 1 output -> 3d plot, not animated
        -> [f(x,t), x, t] for x,t
    "plot f(x,t) for x=..." 1+1 inputs, 1 output -> 2d plot, animated
        -> [f(x,t), x] for x    // t is special
    "plot f(t)" 0+1 inputs, 1 output -> 1d animated? 2d not animated?
        -> [f(t), t] for t,
            where t goes from (current time - N seconds) up to (current time) ?
        automatic t
        animated
    "plot f(t) for t=..." 1 input, 1 output -> 2d not animated
        -> [f(t), t] for t, where t is not special
    "plot [a,b;c,d] for ..." -> doesn't make sense
    "plot [sin(s), cos(s/2)] for s=..." 1 input, 2 outputs -> 2d plot
        -> [sin(s), cos(s/2)] for s

    "plot sin(x)" 2d plot?
        -> [sin(_), _] for _

    "plot {[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]}" plot of set of 2d vectors: 2d plot
    "plot [1,2]" plot of single 2d vector?
        -> [1,2] for _
    "plot {[1,2,3], [4,5,6]}" plot of set of 3d vectors: 3d plot
    "plot a for a in A" depends on what A is
    "plot x for x in [0,2)" continuous interval
    "plot x for x in [0..100]" integer interval

    "plot sin" ??? just the function itself? infer inputs and outputs?
        requires unified namespace and related fixes to macros and parsing
        -> [sin(x), x] for x

    "plot f(x) for f in {sin, cos, tan}, 0 <= x < 2*pi" ? ðŸ¤”
        requires unified namespace and sets

plot colors and other things
    color
    temporal (time-based) vars
    axes on or off
    xmax, xmin, etc

handle discontinuities in curves and surfaces

utility functions for things like polar plots and sphere plots

add common constants, like e and pi. we can already print them (kinda sorta,
        inexact equality comparison). not that irrational numbers cannot be
        represented by IEEE floating point.
